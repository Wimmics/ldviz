# LDViz (Linked Data Visualizer)

LDViz is a versatile, web-based visualization tool designed for exploring Linked Open Data (LOD) using multiple visualization techniques. It is compatible with any SPARQL endpoint that adheres to W3C standards, specifically those delivering SPARQL select result sets in the JSON format as defined by the W3C Recommendation.

Primarily functioning as a SPARQL query manager, LDViz allows users to create, edit, and clone SPARQL queries. Each query can be linked to a visualization technique, which will then be used to visualize the query results.
